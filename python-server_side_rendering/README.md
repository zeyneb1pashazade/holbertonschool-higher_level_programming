# 🖥️ Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Python & Flask

## 📘 Introduction

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a powerful web development technique where HTML pages are generated on the **server** before being sent to the **client**. Unlike client-side rendering—where JavaScript builds the page in the browser—SSR delivers fully formed HTML, enhancing performance, SEO, and accessibility.

In this project, you will learn how to implement SSR in Python using the **Flask** framework and the **Jinja2** templating engine. You will build dynamic web pages, integrate multiple types of data sources, and understand how Flask renders content efficiently and securely.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

### **1. Understand Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

* Grasp how SSR works and how it differs from client-side rendering
* Understand when and why SSR is beneficial in modern web development

### **2. Implement SSR with Flask**

* Build routes that return fully rendered HTML
* Use Flask’s rendering functions to generate dynamic pages

### **3. Work with Jinja2 Templates**

* Write reusable templates with Jinja
* Use variables, loops, conditionals, and template inheritance

### **4. Integrate Multiple Data Sources**

Learn how to read and display content from:

* **JSON** files
* **CSV** files
* **SQLite** databases

### **5. Handle Dynamic Content & User Input**

* Process form data
* Display filtered or user-specific information
* Update rendered pages based on runtime data

## 🧠 What to Expect

Throughout this project, you will build a fully functional Flask SSR application. You will:

* Start with basic Flask routes and simple HTML templates
* Progress to dynamic pages populated from external data sources
* Use Jinja2 to structure and render content efficiently
* Handle real user input and update pages accordingly
* Learn essential backend patterns used in Python-based web development

By the end, you will have a solid understanding of how to create **scalable**, **SEO-friendly**, and **maintainable** SSR web applications.
